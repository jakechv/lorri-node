#+TITLE: Skira Dev Environment
This is a Nix development environment used to work on Node.js projects.

It's designed to be used with [[https://direnv.net][direnv]] and [[https://github.com/target/lorri][lorri]] to automatically configure and
load a development environment with nodejs and postgres available.

The following shell commands are exposed:
- startdb :: Starts the database.
- stopdb :: Stops the database.
- restart-db :: Restarts the database. Starts the database if it isn't currently running.
- reset-db :: Deletes the database and reinstantiates it it.
- setup-db :: Sets up the postgres database.

* Configuration
The system assumes a simple database configuration with a single user and database.
The name of the database as well as the username and password of the user are defined
as shell environment variables in '.envrc'.
