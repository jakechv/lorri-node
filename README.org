#+TITLE: Skira Dev Environment
This is a nix-shell development environment used to work on products for Skira AB.

It's designed to be used with direnv and nix-shell to automatically configure a development
environment with nodejs and postgres available and configured.

It exposes the following convenience functions:
- restart-db :: Restarts the database. Starts the database if it is not currently running.
- reset-db :: Deletes the database and reinitializes it.
- setup-db :: Sets up the database.
- startdb :: Start the database.
- Stopdb :: Stop the database.

* TODO - start-skira :: Starts Pumbaa, Mufasa and Nala. Assumes that the three applications are cloned as subdirectories of this repository. Currently only works from the directory in which shell.nix is defined.
* TODO - gen-env-files :: Generates .env files for each of Pumbaa, Mufasa and Nala. Currently only works from the base directory of the project.
